# Meme Search Engine - Next Steps

This document outlines the next steps required to complete the Meme Search Engine project.

## Testing Required

1. **Search Functionality**
   - Test empty searches (should return a list of memes)
   - Test short queries (less than 3 characters)
   - Test direct keyword searches (e.g., "cat")
   - Test semantic searches (e.g., "funny animal")
   - Verify that results include both direct and semantic matches where appropriate

2. **Redis Caching**
   - Verify that the first search creates a cache entry
   - Verify that subsequent identical searches use the cache
   - Test with Redis monitoring to ensure TTL is being set correctly

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Test the rate limiting functionality by making multiple requests in a short period
   - Verify the correct error message is returned when rate limit is exceeded

4. **Vercel Blob Image Loading**
   - Verify that images load correctly from Vercel Blob
   - Check image loading performance with various sizes of memes

## Deployment

1. **Vercel Deployment**
   - Deploy the application to Vercel
   - Configure all required environment variables on Vercel
   - Test the application in production

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Make sure all API keys and environment variables are properly set up in Vercel's project settings

## Future Improvements

1. **UI Enhancements**
   - Implement a dark mode toggle
   - Add image zoom/expand on click
   - Add loading states during searches

2. **Search Enhancements**
   - Add filters for different meme categories
   - Implement pagination for large result sets

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Add image optimization for better loading performance
   - Implement incremental static regeneration for popular searches
